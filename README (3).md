## Colors and Font
The chosen colors were dark purple, light purple, white, and bisque. The dark purple and light purple are monochromatic colors. They go well with eachother and give off a royalty/professional vibe. The goal for my layout was royalty, simple and clean. White was a complementary color to both purples, allowing for vibrant text on the page. Bisque was a bright color that stood out well on the purple, which is why I chose it for the headings.

The font chosen was Rogie. It is an elegant font, with a hint of fanciness to it. It adds to the theme I was going for.
