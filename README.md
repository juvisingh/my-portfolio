## Colors and Font
The chosen colors were dark purple, light purple, white, and bisque. The dark purple and light purple are monochromatic colors. They go well with eachother and give off a royalty/professional vibe. The goal for my layout was royalty, simple and clean. White was a complementary color to both purples, allowing for vibrant text on the page. Bisque was a bright color that stood out well on the purple, which is why I chose it for the headings. The red is used when the user hovers over text. I chose red because it is a color that alerts the user, allowing for more response and attention from the user

The font chosen was Rogie. It is an elegant font, with a hint of fanciness to it. It adds to the theme I was going for.
## Home Page
The home page first has the quotes fade in. It shows my use of CSS for special effects. It displays my name at the top and has a picture of me on the right, as well as a label for who I am. Scrolling down, the user sees a professional picture of me: showing me networking with others. To the right of it is a set of my skills and a small insight of my resume. There is a button present to lead the user directly to the resume page if wanted. Lastly, the bottom has 4 progress bars. They represent the coding languages I know and how far I am, knowledge wise, with them. 
## About Page
The about page is fairly simple. It displays some key features about me and my life. It gives insight to the user of who I am and shows off my skills/passions outside of the coding world.
## Resume Page
The resume page consists of 4 flippable card type objects. The user can click on them to flip them over and reveal key information about me. It talks about my objective, education, and much more. The user can download my full resume by clicking the download button, next to the title on the top of the page.
## Gallery Page
This consist of a 3D gallery. The user can click on the next and previous buttons to scroll through my top projects. It is made efficent and pleasing for the user. It also includes links to the github page, as well as the live website, to all my projects. 
## Contact Page
The contact page has some information about me, such as when I am available, and it thanks the user for taking the time to view my portfolio. Then, there are logos that display and link my email as well as my overall github page for the user.
