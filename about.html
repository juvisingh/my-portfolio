            <h2 style="font-weight: normal; padding-bottom:10px; text-indent:50px">Hi, my name is Juvraj Singh and I currently live in Arizona. I am currently finishing my highschool diploma and hope to become a high level software developer in the future. I appreciate your time and consideration in reviewing my portfolio.</h2>
            <h2 style="font-weight: normal; padding-bottom:10px; text-indent:50px">I was born and raised in
                Glendale, Arizona. I went to middle school at Basis Peoria, a charter school, and high school at
                Mountain Ridge High School. Basis Peoria was a nationally ranked school with a very tough
                curriculum. It pushed me to become better and better every day. Mountain Ridge is a great
                school as well, known for its academics in the region. At my high school, I am part of NHS
                (National Honors Society). The program and I volunteer regularly at places such as the St.Maryâ€™s
                Food Bank. In addition, I attend the West-Mec Coding program. Here, I expand my knowledge in the coding field and participate in FBLA (Future
                Business Leaders of America). At regionals, I won third place for my event of Public Service
                Announcement and won second place in leadership. Recently, at state, I placed 5th place in PSA and 6th in Entrepreneurship, granitng me a spot to nationals this year. I have played basketball my entire life and
                continue to play to this day.</h2>
            <h2 style="font-weight: normal; text-indent:50px">Most of the skills I have acquired over the years have come from school, basketball, and
                track. Starting with school, I have taken difficult courses over my high school career. From
                freshman year to now, I have taken a total of three AP Classes, two college dual classes, and all
                the rest being honor classes. Managing these classes while being in track season has taught me
                how to become an efficient time manager. I have learned to prioritize certain things and do well
                in school. It has been working, as seen in how I have had all As so far in my high school years.
                Moving on, I play on a club basketball team named AZ Heat. I have practices twice a week as
                well as games on Saturdays. On top of all of this, I take West-Mec. This is a two-and-a-half-hour
                class for coding. I go to my homeschool from 7:20 am-12:17 pm and go to West-Mec from 4:00
                pm - 6:30 pm. It is a very tough schedule but it has taught me to use my time wisely and get my
                work done. During my basketball season, I won an MVP (most valuable player) award. This is
                when I knew that I could reach any goal I wanted if I put my mind to it. I have carried this on
                over and I am applying it to my future.</h2>
